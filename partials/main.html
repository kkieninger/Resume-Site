	<h1>Oh, hello.</h1>
	<p>My name is Kevin. I'm a former marketing and communications professional turned front-end web developer. A Swiss Army Knife, I've worn a lot of hats and worked in a multitude of disciplines throughout my career.
	<p>I've launched publicity campaigns for buzzing indie musicians, helped seniors celebrate their golden years, announced multi-million dollar real estate developments, and helped America's oldest detective agency reinvent themselves for the 21st Century. My latest hat is as a project management extraordinaire juggling traditional and digital ad campaigns.</p>
	<p>Outside of work, you can often find my nose in a book, raising hell in Ferndale or hitting the road for a long weekend. I love great people, good beer and discovering the most complicated way to make the best cup of coffee. </p>
